# CPE 400 Networking Project
## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a simple simulation environment that users can play with to get a feeling for how all the different protocols in the internet work. Obiously, the scope of that is quite large, so only a few of them will be implemented for this class.


## Key protocols that will be demostrated
* TCP
* IPv4
* HTTP
* DNS?

## Things that need to be completed
* Create a function to add nodes in locations besides the origin.
* Create a function to make nodes moveable
* Create router nodes.
    * Add Packets
* potentially could just be a box moving along the path.
* Add support so that when a user zooms out, nodes no longer show text and become clickable.
* Add some kind of way to add packets to each node with destination/payload
